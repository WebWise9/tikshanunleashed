	<p> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>Hi there, I'm Tikshan Rajdev, a 17-year-old with a passion for coding, writing, public speaking, and dogs. I've been coding for just over a year, and in that time, I've already created more than two websites. On top of that, I'm also in the process of writing a book, which I'm excited to publish soon!
<br><br>
When I'm not buried in code or lost in my writing, I love spending time with animals, especially dogs. They're my ultimate stress-relievers, and nothing beats a good snuggle session with a furry friend. Aside from dogs, I'm also passionate about public speaking, and I love the thrill of standing in front of a crowd and sharing my thoughts and ideas.

<br><br>Recently, I just finished my 10th class, and I'm excited to continue my educational journey. But, let me be clear, I'm not just in this to get good grades or to please anyone else. I'm passionate about my work, and I'm coming in hot and ready to leave everyone else in the dust. So, watch out world, here I come!
<br><br>
One of my favorite quotes that really resonates with me is "Crying does not indicate that you are weak, since birth it has always been a sign that you are alive." I believe that this quote really speaks to the idea that it's okay to show emotions and express them in a healthy way. Life can be tough, and it's through our struggles and challenges that we grow and become stronger.

<br><br>I'm also a spiritual person who believes in peace and love. For me, it's important to spread positivity and kindness wherever I go. Life can be tough enough as it is, and I believe that by being kind and understanding towards others, we can make a real difference in the world.

<br><br>Now, let me tell you a bit more about who I am and what I stand for. I'm a young, ambitious individual who is determined to make a difference in the world. I'm not just looking to coast through life or follow in someone else's footsteps. Instead, I'm driven by my passions, my curiosity, and my desire to create something truly unique and meaningful.
<br><br>As a coder, I love nothing more than to bring my ideas to life through code. Whether it's building a website from scratch or creating a new app, I thrive on the challenge of turning an idea into a tangible reality. I'm always learning and exploring new coding languages, and I'm excited to see where this passion takes me.<br><br>
As a writer, I'm equally passionate about expressing my thoughts and ideas through words. I believe that writing is a powerful tool for sharing our experiences, connecting with others, and making sense of the world around us. Whether it's fiction or non-fiction, I'm always looking for new ways to challenge myself and push my writing skills to the next level.<br><br>
As a public speaker, I'm driven by a desire to share my ideas with others and to inspire change. Whether it's a crowd approach or a simple presentation in class, I love the rush of standing in front of an audience and delivering a powerful message. I believe that everyone has a story to tell, and I'm committed to helping others find their voice and share their own unique perspective with the world.<br><br>
Finally, as a dog lover, I stand for the power of unconditional love and companionship. For me, dogs are more than just pets – they're family. They bring joy, comfort, and a sense of connection to my life, and I'm committed to giving them the love and respect they deserve.<br><br>
To add a bit of humour in the intro, I would like to crack a joke: Why was the computer qurantined?<br>
Because it had a virus! Yes i know it is'nt that good but i will surely work on my delivery.<br><br>
At last I want to express my gratitude to all of you for taking the time to interact with me.<BR>
PEACE OUT!!!!
